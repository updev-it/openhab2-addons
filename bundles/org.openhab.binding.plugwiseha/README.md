# PlugwiseHA Binding

The Plugwise Home Automation binding adds support to openHAB for the [Plugwise Home Automation ecosystem](https://www.plugwise.com/en_US/adam_zone_control). This system is built around a gateway from Plugwise called the 'Adam' which incorporates a ZigBee controller to manage thermostatic radiator valves, room thermostats, floor heating pumps, et cetera.

Users can manage and control this system either via a web app or a mobile phone app developed by Plugwise. The (web) app allows users to define heating zone's (e.g. rooms) and add radiator valves to those rooms to manage and control their heating irrespective of other rooms.

Using the Plugwise Home Automation binding you can incorporate the management of these devices and heating zones into openHAB. The binding uses the same RESTfull API that both the mobile phone app and the web app use.

The binding requires users to have a working Plugwise Home Automation setup consisting of at least 1 gateway device (the 'Adam') and preferably 1 radiator valve as a bare minimum. The 'Adam' (from hereon called the gateway) needs to be accessible from the openHAB instance via a TCP/IP connection.

## Discovery

After setting up the Plugwise Home Automation bridge you can start a manual scan to find all devices registered on the gateway. You can also manually add things by entering the corresponding device id as a configuration parameter. The device id's can be found be enabling TRACE logging in the Karaf console.

## Thing Configuration

You must define a Plugwise Home Automation gateway (Bridge) before defining zones or appliances (Things) for this binding to work.
